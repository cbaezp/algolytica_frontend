    "FAQ1": "What is sports Arbitrage?",
    "FAQ1Text": "Sports arbitrage, also known as surebet, is a strategy that leverages variations in odds provided by different sources for the same event. By allocating resources to all possible outcomes, an individual can secure a favorable result regardless of the event's outcome. This works because sources often assess the likelihood of events differently, leading to varying odds and potential returns. Identifying these discrepancies allows a person to distribute resources strategically across all outcomes, ensuring a positive result if the allocations are calculated correctly.",
    "FAQ2": "What are +Ev opportunities?",
    "FAQ2Text": "Positive expected value (EV) scenarios occur when the anticipated return is greater than the amount risked. In other words, if an individual were to repeatedly engage in the same scenario, over time, they would expect to achieve a positive outcome. This happens because the probabilities, when compared to the potential return, are favorable.",
