    "FAQ1": "What is sports Arbitrage?",
    "FAQ1Text": "Sports arbitrage, also known as surebet, is a strategy that leverages variations in odds provided by different bookmakers for the same event. By allocating wagers on all possible outcomes, an individual can secure a profit regardless of the event's result. This works because bookmakers often assess the likelihood of events differently, leading to varying odds and potential payouts. Identifying these discrepancies allows a person to distribute wagers strategically across all outcomes with different bookmakers, ensuring a profit if the stakes are calculated correctly, no matter the event's result.",
    "FAQ2": "What are +Ev opportunities?",
    "FAQ2Text": "Positive expected value (EV) scenarios occur when the anticipated return is greater than the amount risked. In other words, if an individual were to repeatedly engage in the same scenario, over time, they would expect to achieve a profit. This happens because the probabilities, when compared to the potential payout, are favorable to the individual.",
