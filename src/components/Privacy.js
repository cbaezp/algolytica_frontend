            Cookies. Like many online services, we use "cookies" to collect
            technical information. Cookies are small pieces of information that
            a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing
            the website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you
            close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your
            computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal
            and interactive experience on our Website and App. We may use
            cookies to collect information about your IP address, browser type,
            operating system, device type and identifiers, platform type, as
            well as your usage of and activity on our Website and Application(s)
            and the performance of our Services. These types of information are
            collected to make the Website and App more useful to you and to
            tailor your online experience to meet your special interests and
            expectations. You can use the options in your web browser to notify
            you when you receive a cookie or you may change your cookie
            preferences in your Internet browser or with third parties. You can
            control and/or delete cookies used by our Services at any time. For

            Pixel Tags. In addition, we use "pixel tags" (also referred to as
            clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic
            images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,
            that are used to track online movements of web users. In contrast to
            cookies, which are stored on a computer's hard drive or web browser,
            pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags are often
            used in combination with cookies, trigger the placing of cookies,
            and transmit information to us or our service providers. This
            enables two websites to share information. The resulting connection
            can include information such as a device's IP address, the time a
            person viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with the browser
            or device, the type of browser being used and the URL of the web
            page from which the pixel was viewed. Pixel tags also allow us to
            send email messages in a format that users can read, tell us whether
            emails have been opened, and help to ensure I am sending only
            messages that may be of interest to our users. We may also use this
            information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.

            not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, Snapchat,
            FantasyPros, LiveRamp, The Trade Desk and TruSignal, may collect
            information about you and your visits to this and other websites.
            That information may include your IP address, internet service
            provider, unique personal identifiers (e.g., email address), and the
            browser you use to visit and use our Services and other websites and
            applications. They may do this by using cookies, beacons, pixel
            tags, clear gifs, or other technologies. The information collected

            to your interests and to better understand your usage of,

        <p className=" text-gray-900 mt-2">
          Various browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari,
          currently offer a "Do Not Track" or "DNT" option that relies on a
          technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites
          visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting.
          Please note that, at this time, we do not honor "DNT" signals or other
          mechanisms that may allow you to opt out of the collection of
          information across networks of websites and online services as there
          is no standard for how online services should respond to such signals.
          As standards evolve, we may develop policies for responding to DNT

          applicants, employees and other of our personnel or information about
          employees and other representatives of third-party entities we may
          interact with. When we receive a request, we will verify the identity
          of the requestor and undertake to respond within the periods set by
          California law. If a CA customer has a password-protected account with
          us, we may verify their identity through our existing authentication
          practices and will require him or her to re-authenticate themselves
          before disclosing or deleting the customer's data. If a CA customer
          does not have a password-protected account, we will take reasonable
          steps to verify their identity in accordance with the CCPA prior to
          responding any request. The verification steps may vary depending on
          the sensitivity of the personal information. If we cannot verify a
          requestor's identity using these methods, we may use an appropriate
          third-party verification service.

        <p class="mt-2">
          CA customers may use an authorized agent to submit a Request to Know
          or a Request to Delete. An authorized agent is a person or entity
          registered with the California Secretary of State that a CA customer
          has authorized to act on his or her behalf. If you choose to submit a
          privacy request to us through an authorized agent, we may require that
          you provide the agent with written permission to do so and that the
          agent verify their own identity with us. If your privacy request is
          submitted by an agent without proof that they have been authorized by
          you to act on your behalf, we may deny the request.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">"Shine the Light" Law</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          A CA customer who has provided personal information to a business with
          whom he has established a business relationship for personal, family,
          or household purposes is entitled to request information about whether
          the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties
          for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the
          business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon
          receipt of a request by a CA customer, the business is required to
          provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was
          disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the
          categories of personal information that were disclosed.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the
          above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the
          public (in its privacy policy or notice) a policy of not disclosing
          customers' personal information to third parties for their direct
          marketing purposes unless the business gives users a mechanism to opt
          out of having their personal information disclosed to third parties
          for their direct marketing purposes. Rather, the business may comply
          with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent
          disclosure of personal information and providing a cost-free means to
          exercise the right.
